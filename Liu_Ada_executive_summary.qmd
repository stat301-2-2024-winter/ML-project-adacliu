## Executive Summary: Predicting Mushroom Edibility

# Overview and Purpose

My project seeks to develop predictive models to accurately classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. The motivation behind this project stems from the vast health benefits of mushrooms, the risks associated with consuming poisonous varieties, and a personal interest in mushroom foraging.

Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, originally contributed by the UCL Machine Learning repository, I analyzed 8,124 hypothetical mushroom samples representing 23 species. The dataset, which is primarily categorical, underwent thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. The data was split using a stratified selection method, with an 80/20 ratio for training and test sets, respectively.

# Key Points and Major Results

In this project, I investigated the capabilities machine learning models offer in mushroom foraging to identify safe and non-safe mushrooms. We started by splitting our data into train and test sets; building models using the train data and evaluating their performance on the test data. Data preprocessing steps were done to prepare the data for analysis. A new feature *bad_smell* was created to group odors that indicate bad smell and those that do not. Six machine learning models were fit and evaluated on different subsets of features selected by three models.

My project employed six machine learning models: Naive Bayes, Unpenalized Logistic Regression, Penalized Ridge Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. These models underwent fine-tuning with a 5-fold cross-validation method on the training data. Remarkably, both Decision Tree and Random Forest models achieved perfect scores across various metrics, standing out for their accuracy and reliability. Conversely, the Naive Bayes model displayed weaker performance when using features selected by Lasso Regression and Decision Trees. 

Feature selection played a crucial role in enhancing model efficiency, with techniques derived from Lasso Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests enabling a more focused analysis without sacrificing performance. Ultimately, the Random Forest model was selected as the superior option due to its robustness against overfitting and its comprehensive approach in aggregating predictions from multiple trees. This model's efficacy was underscored by its performance on the test data, where it accurately identified all samples as either edible or poisonous without error.

The random forest model was chosen as the best model based on its superiority over decision trees and its robust nature in controlling overfitting since the predictions from different trees are averaged before a class is assigned to an instance. In addition, from the feature importance plot, we see that the odor of a mushroom is one physical characteristic that determines its edibility. Others include gill size, color, and spacing, stalk surface below and above the ring, the ring type, habitat, the spore print color, bruises and stalk shape.

# Conclusions

The study revealed that certain physical characteristics, such as odor, gill size, color, and spacing, are pivotal in determining a mushroom's edibility. These insights are invaluable for mushroom foragers, allowing them to prioritize these traits in their foraging efforts to ensure safety and sustainability. This project not only demonstrated the practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios but also contributed to the broader understanding of how technology can aid in the identification of safe and unsafe mushrooms, promoting health and environmental well-being.
